# Technology overview

## What is MLOps?

MLOps, also known as DevOps for machine learning, is the practice of collaboration and communication between data scientists and DevOps professionals to help manage the production of the machine learning lifecycle.

You can learn more about MLOps and how to use Azure Machine Learning service to manage the model lifecycles at: [MLOps: Manage, deploy, and monitor models with Azure Machine Learning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-model-management-and-deployment)

# Quickstart Overview

The goal of this quickstart is to build a simple use case that shows how you can operationalize your machine learning models that leverages the [Azure DevOps Machine Learning extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-air-aiagility.vss-services-azureml), [Azure ML CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli), and [Azure Machine Learning Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-pipeline-core/azureml.pipeline.core?view=azure-ml-py) that integrate with [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) CI/CD and deployment workflows.

## Before you begin

Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) using the same sign in as your [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).
