## Next Steps

If you have not cloned this repository to your Azure notebooks under the project `Aml-quickstarts`, do so now. All of the artifacts for this lab are located under `starter-artifacts/python-notebooks`.

### Open the starting Python Notebook
1. Within Azure Notebook, under `My Projects` open the project `Aml-quickstarts`. 
2. In the project expand the folder `05-aml-automl`.
3. To run a lab, you can start your project to run on the DLVM you created as part of setup in `lab-0`.
4. Open `automl-with-AML.ipynb`. This is the Python notebook you will step thru executing in this lab.
5. Confirm that `Python 3.6 â€“ AzureML` is set as your kernel for your notebook.

### Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab
