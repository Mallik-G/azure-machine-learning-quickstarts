    "# Train a deep learning model\n",
    "In this notebook you will train a deep learning model to classify the descriptions of car components as compliant or non-compliant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each document in the supplied training data set is a short text description of the component as documented by an authorized technician. \n",
    "The contents include:\n",
    "- Manufacture year of the component (e.g. 1985, 2010)\n",
    "- Condition of the component (poor, fair, good, new)\n",
    "- Materials used in the component (plastic, carbon fiber, steel, iron)\n",
    "\n",
    "The compliance regulations dictate:\n",
    "*Any component manufactured before 1995 or in fair or poor condition or made with plastic or iron is out of compliance.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "* Manufactured in 1985 made of steel in fair condition -> **Non-compliant**\n",
    "* Good condition carbon fiber component manufactured in 2010 -> **Compliant**\n",
    "* Steel component manufactured in 1995 in fair condition -> **Non-Compliant**\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels present in this data are 0 for compliant, 1 for non-compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with classifying text data is that deep learning models only undertand vectors (e.g., arrays of numbers) and not text. To encode the car component descriptions as vectors, we use an algorithm from Stanford called [GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). GloVe provides us pre-trained vectors that we can use to convert a string of text into a vector."
